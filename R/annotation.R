#' peakAnnotation
#' 
#' Searches for isotopic ions in the peak matrix and evaluates them using morphology, intensity and mass error criteria.
#' This algorithm only searches carbon-based isotopic ions.
#' Using the infromation generated by the isotopes test, the algorithm then proceeds to search adduct pairs between the monoisotopic ions.
#' 
#' @param PeakMtx List. An rMSIprocPeakMatrix. Must contain at least the following categories: \itemize{
#' \item PeakMtx$intensity. A matrix containg the intensities of the peaks for each pixel (rows = pixels, cols = ions).  
#' \item PeakMtx$mass. A vector containg the masses of each peak. Must be in the same order with the columns of the intensity marix.   
#' \item PeakMtx$numPixels. Number of pixels (rows in your matrix).   
#' }
#' @param iso.number Integer. Number of isotopes to be found.
#' @param iso.tolerance Integer. Mass tolerance for the isotope candidates in scans or ppms.
#' @param iso.scoreThreshold Numeric. Score value to consider a ion mass a good isotope candidate. Only the ions that have this number or greater will undergo the following isotope searching stages.
#' @param iso.toleranceUnits String. Must be 'ppm' or 'scan'. If ToleranceUnits is 'scan' then ImageVector must be the mass channels vector of the rMSI image (rMSIObj$mass).
#' @param iso.imageVector Numeric Vector. The mass channels vector of the imaging dataset containing all the scans.
#' 
#' @param add.adductDataFrame Data frame with two columns.\itemize{
#'  \item $name. Column containing the names as strings of the elements or molecules that form adducts 
#'  \item $mass. Masses of the adduct forming elements.
#'  }
#' @param add.tolerance Integer. Mass error tolerance in ppm.
#' @return A list of lists. All the infomarion related with the isotopes can be found in $isotopes sub-list, and the same for adducts in the $adducts sub-list.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item $isotopes: List of lists. Contains the followin sub-lists:
#'    \itemize{
#'    \item $Mn: List of matrices. Contains all the M+n ions evaluated and the results matrix. The name of the lists referes to the peak selected as monoisotopic.
#'    \item $isotopicPeaks: Vector. Indices of the mass vector beloning to isotopic peaks.
#'    \item $monoisotopicPeaks: Vector. Indices of the mass vector beloning to monoisotopic peaks.
#'   }
#'   \item $adducts: List of matrices. Contains all the adduct pairs found during the test. The names refer to the neutral masses of the hypothetic ions.
#' }
